# Problem
Customer Chrun Prediction 
# Problem Statement 
An E Commerce company or DTH (you can choose either of these two domains) provider is facing a lot of competition in the current market and it has become a 
challenge to retain the existing customers in the current situation. Hence, the company wants to develop a model through which they can do churn prediction of 
the accounts and provide segmented offers to the potential churners. In this company, account churn is a major thing because 1 account can have multiple customers. 
hence by losing one account the company might be losing more than one customer.You have been assigned to develop a churn prediction model for this company and 
provide business recommendations on the campaign.
# Approach 
1. Understanding the data to it's depth: All the columns were given appropriate time and procedure to understand. They were seperately checked for null values and bad
data. Some columns were marked as object through they were numeric due to presence of bad data. All the observations were jotted down carefully.
2. Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: After a required overview of each column, We ran a Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis through matplotlib and seaborn to
understand the relationship between each independent column and targeted column (that is Churn) 
3. Imputation and Treating the Outliers: Once done with above two procedure, We imputed the null values, treated the bad data, treated the outliers as well- 
Imputations were carefully done to avoid missing out on extreme values that might be valuable in our analysis.
